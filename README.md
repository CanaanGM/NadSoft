# NadSoftMVVM

## Idea
  - Business Card App that let's you register your contacts.

## Base Structure
  The app is based on the Firebase Firestore for the Back-end, 
  The Front-end is an android application.
  
## How can it be imporved ?
  - Writing Unit Test
  - Writing Instrument Test
  - Modularize Architecture with Dynamic Feature Modules, but I thought it will be an over kill here.

## Time took? 
  - 2:01 Hours
  
## Android Structure
  * The Android application is built using the MVVM design pattern.
  * The Application can also be used offline (Offline First Application).
